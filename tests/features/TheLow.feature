Feature: Partywithray Proof of Membership

    As a Partywithray Fan,
    I want to buy "The Low" Proof of Membership NFT,
    so that I can get more involved in his community and receive exclusive merch and access.

    Background: Deploy and Mint
        Given the Partywithray Proof of Membership NFT contract is deployed

    Scenario: Mint on creation
        Then the name should be "partywithray - The Low" and the symbol should "LOW"
        And the supply should be 222
        And all 222 NFTs should have the pre-reveal art
        And each NFT title should be "The Low {id}/222"
        And each NFT description should be "A Proof of Membership NFT for partywithray fans, granting future access to shows, new music, and merch. âš¡ Dev by Hyperforge, a smart contract development and security research firm. Design by Kairos Music, a music NFT information platform that seeks to make a living salary for artists in the music industry achievable."
        And royalties should be set at 750 basis points going to the "Big Night" address
        And the ability to mint more NFTs should be frozen

    @Manual
    Scenario: List for sale
        When we list the Partywithray NFTs on OpenSea
        Then 211 NFTs should be listed as Buy It Now for 0.0111 ETH
        And 11 NFTs should be held in the TODOBigNightENSName vault

    Scenario: Reveal when sells out
        Given 11 NFTs were held for promo and all remaining 211 NFTs were sold
        When we reveal the art
        Then there should be 222 tokens with the following metadata and quantities:
            | Tier             | Rarity      | Image                                                              | Animation URI                                                      | Animation Hash                                                   | Quantity | Number |

        And calling reveal a second time should not change any tiers

    Scenario: Reveal when does not sell out
        Given 11 NFTs were held for promo and less than remaining 211 NFTs were sold
        When we decide to vault a percentage and burn a percentage of unsold NFTs
        And we reveal the art
        Then there should be the correct amount of tokens in the vault and in total supply
        And the ability to update metadata should be frozen
        And the ability to reduce supply should be frozen

        Scenario Template: Reveal when does not sell out
        When we reduce the supply to <supply>
        And we reveal the art
        Then the distribution should be <tier5> ultrarares, <tier4> rares, <tier3> uncommons, <tier2> commons, and <tier1> ultracommons
        Examples:
            | supply | tier5 | tier4 | tier3 | tier2 | tier1 |
            | 221    | 3     | 11    | 22    | 75    | 110   |
            | 200    | 3     | 10    | 20    | 68    | 99    |
            | 175    | 3     | 9     | 18    | 60    | 85    |
            | 150    | 3     | 8     | 15    | 51    | 73    |
            | 100    | 2     | 5     | 10    | 34    | 49    |
            | 50     | 1     | 3     | 5     | 17    | 24    |


    Scenario: Reducing Supply does not change titles
        Given an initial mint of 222
        And Bob buys tokenId 201
        And Alice buys tokenId 83
        And 98 other people buy various tokenIds, for a total sale of 100 items
        When the team reduces the supply to 100
        Then the title of tokenId 201 should be "The Low 201/222" and its owner should be Bob
        And the title of tokenId 83 should be "The Low 83/222" and its owner should be Alice
